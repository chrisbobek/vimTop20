# The Top 20 vim Commands and Tips That You Should Know

## #20
`:q!` translates to force quit.
If you don't know vim and you suddenly find yourself in vim, type `:q!` followed by `enter`.
This command closes the file without saving any changes.
(If you typed `:q!` and added it to the content of the file, hit the `ESC` key and
type `:q!`, `enter` again.)

## #19
If you're in vim's -- INSERT -- mode, the `ESC` key activates vim's Normal mode.
If it's hard to hit the `ESC` key without looking, try `C-[` (Ctrl+[).
(Even better: map your CAPS LOCK key to Ctrl.)
